\frametitle{Motivating Question}

\begin{itemize}
	\item When and why do states comply with economic sanctions? 
	\item We demonstrate the necessity of incorporating network dynamics into understanding the time until sanction compliance
	\item We show that the connectivity between target and sender states plays an important and previously overlooked role on sanction outcomes
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Sanctions and domestic factors}
Previous literature has suggested sanctions ``work'' by destablizing leaders and other domestic factors:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Marinov 2005
	\item Lektzian and Souva 2003
\end{itemize}

Such work has often utilized a duration modeling approach to capture the time until sanction compliance: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bolks Al-Sowayel 2000
	\item McGillivray and Stam 2004
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Sanctions and Network Dynamics}
Domestic conditions are important but cross-cutting relationships and network dynamics should play a key role in understanding sanction outcomes as well:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bapat and Morgan 2009
	\item Cranmer and Heinrich 2013
\end{itemize}

The importance of network dynamics are noted in other IR works:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ward, Siverson, and Xao 2007
	\item Cranmer and Desmarais 2012
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Bridging the Gaps}
We suggest that present duration approaches fail to incorporate the network pressures instrinstic to international sanction processes

\begin{itemize}
	\item Target states face sanctioners to whom they have a variety of relationships
	\item At any given point in time, target states may be faced with a multitude of sanction cases
	\item We present a duration model that incorporates these network dynamics
\end{itemize}

\framesubtitle{Sanction Case Network}

\begin{block}{Hypothesis 1 \& 2}
	Sanction Case Network: The relationship between sender(s) and the target matters for sanction compliance: 
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
	\item As the number of sender states increases for any given sanction case, the time to compliance will decrease
	\item Sanction cases where relationships between sender(s) and receiver(s) are more proximate will be more quickly resolved
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Conceptualizing Networks}

Two types of network effects that we capture:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sanction Case Network
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Number of senders associated with a sanction case
		\item Distance: The average distance between sender(s) and the receiver
		\item Trade: The share of total trade that the sender(s) make up for the receiver		
		\item Alliances: The proportion of sender(s) that are allied with the receiver
		\item IGOs: The average number of common IGOs that the sender(s) and receiver belong to
		\item Religion: Similarity of religious group makeups between sender(s) and the receiver
	\end{itemize}
	\item Aggregate Network
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sanctions Received: Total number of sanctions to which the target state is currently exposed
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

	\item Our focus is economic sanctions and the period of 1984 to 2013, providing us with 272 sanction cases \\

\frametitle{Dependent Variable}
\framesubtitle{Sanction Compliance}

\begin{block}{Conceptualization of Dependent Variable}
	We define compliance as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Complete/Partial Acquiescence by Target to threat
		\item Negotiated Settlement
		\item Total/Partial Acquiescence by the Target State following sanctions imposition
		\item Negotiated Settlement following sanctions imposition
	\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
