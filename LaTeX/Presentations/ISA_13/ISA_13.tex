\frametitle{Motivating Question}

\begin{itemize}
	\item When and why do states comply with economic sanctions? 
	\item In this presentation we demonstrate the necessity of incorporating network dynamics into understanding the time until sanction compliance
	\item We show that the connectivity between target and sender states--in terms of cultural similarities, geographical proximity, and alliance patterns--plays an important and previously overlooked role on sanction outcomes
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sanctions and domestic factors}
Previous literature has suggested sanctions ``work'' by destablizing leaders and other domestic factors:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Marinov 2005
	\item Lektzian and Souva 2003
\end{itemize}

Such work has often utilized a duration modeling approach to capture the time until sanction compliance: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bolks Al-Sowayel 2000
	\item McGillivray and Stam 2004
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sanctions and Network Dynamics}
Domestic conditions are important but cross-cutting relationships and network dynamics should play a key role in understanding sanction outcomes as well:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Martin, 1993; Drezner, 2000; Bapat and Morgan, 2009, Cranmer and Heinrich 2013. 
\end{itemize}

The importance of network dynamics have been found in other IR works:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ward, Siverson, and Xao 2007
	\item Cranmer and Desmarais 2012
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Bridging the Gaps}
We suggest that present duration approaches fail to incorporate the network pressures instrinstic to international sanction processes

\begin{itemize}
	\item Target states face sanctioners to whom they have a variety of relationships
	\item At any given point in time, target states may be faced with a multitude of sanction cases
	\item We present a duration model that incorporates these network dynamics
	\item In addition, we explore whether these network pressures interact with domestic institutions of the target state
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Network Pressure Hypotheses}
\framesubtitle{Sanction Case Network}

\begin{block}{Hypothesis 1}
	Sanction Case Network: The relationship between sender(s) and the target matters for sanction compliance: 
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sanction cases where relationships are more proximate will be more quickly resolved
	\item Sanctions involving coalitions of sender(s) will be more quickly resolved than sanctions sent by just one state
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Network Pressure Hypotheses}
\framesubtitle{Aggregate Network}

\begin{block}{Hypothesis 2}
	Aggregate Network: Targets of sanctions often face a multitude of sanction cases at any given point in time
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
	\item States under the pressure of a multitude of sanctions will more quickly resolve sanction cases than those facing only a few
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Institutions Hypothesis}

\begin{block}{\textbf{Hypothesis 3}}
	Target states with stronger democratic institutions that are under the pressure of sanctions will more quickly comply than those with less democratic institutions. 
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sanctions are designed to impose costs on key groups within countries
	\item Affected groups will lobby the government to reach an accommodation with sanctioning states
	\item The ability to successfully lobby is conditional on political institutions
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conceptualizing Networks}

Two types of network effects that we want to capture:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sanction Case Network
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Number of senders associated with sanction case
		\item Distance: The average distance between sender(s) and the receiver
		\item Trade: The share of total trade that the sender(s) make up for the receiver		
		\item Alliances: The proportion of sender(s) that are allied with the receiver
		\item IGOs: The average number of common IGOs that the sender(s) and receiver belong to
		\item Religion: Similarity of religious group makeups between sender(s) and the receiver
	\end{itemize}
	\item Aggregate Network
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sanctions Received: Total number of sanctions to which the target state is currently exposed
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Data}

Sanction data from Threat and Imposition of Sanctions developed by Morgan (2009), covers 1,412 sanction cases from 1945 to 2005 \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Our focus is economic sanctions and the period of 1984 to 2005, leaving us with 184 sanction cases
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{block}{Conceptualization of Dependent Variable}
	We define compliance as:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Complete/Partial Acquiescence by Target to threat
		\item Negotiated Settlement
		\item Total/Partial Acquiescence by the Target State following sanctions imposition
		\item Negotiated Settlement following sanctions imposition
	\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Time-Varying Duration Model}
	\begin{align*}
		Compliance_{i,t} =\; & No. \; Senders_{j} + Distance_{j,t} + Trade_{j,t}  + \\
		 &Ally_{j,t} + IGOs_{j,t} + Religion_{j,t} +\\
 		 &Sanc. \; Rec'd_{i,t} + \\
		 &Constraints_{i,t} + GDP \; Capita_{i,t-1} +\\
		 & Internal \; Conflict_{i,t} +\\
		 &Constraints_{i,t}*No. \; Senders_{j} + \epsilon_{i,t}
	\end{align*}
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
	\item $i$ represents the target state
	\item $j$ represents the relationship between the set of sender(s) for a particular sanction case and $i$
	\item $t$ the time period

Next Steps
\begin{itemize}
	\item The relationships between sender(s) of a sanction and the target matter, and the specific facets of the relationship that matter extend beyond trade
	\item So far we have not found that the aggregate network structure faced by a state matters for compliance
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There are other conceptualizations of aggregate network pressures that we can pursue
	\end{itemize}
	\item We also did not find support for the institutions hypothesis
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Greater specification of this hypothesis is likely necessary
