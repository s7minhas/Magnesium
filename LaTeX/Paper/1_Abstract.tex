This article explores when and why states comply with sanctions. Previous literature suggests a duration modeling approach is needed to adequately capture the time it takes for a sanction to ``work.'' This approach, however, has failed to carefully account for important dynamics relevant to the theoretical and empirical investigation of sanction outcomes. Namely, present duration approaches fail to incorporate the network effects intrinsic to international sanction processes. We argue that a key network measure, reciprocity, is a crucial component of the strategic linkages between states and influences their willingness to comply to sanctions. We present a model that incorporates this interdependent nature of the international system by including measures of reciprocity within the duration model. In addition, we are able to test whether conditions the literature claims as critical for predicting sanction compliance, such as domestic institutions, remain influential once network dynamics are adequately modeled. In doing so, we test key hypotheses from the literature regarding the role of domestic conditions, instrastate relationships, and our own new hypotheses on the effect of reciprocity on sanction compliance. \\
