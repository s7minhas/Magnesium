\label{Results} 

Table~\ref{tab:regResults} displays the results from our model. To contrast with findings from the extant literature, we run the model in three ways. The first column tests explanations of sanction compliance centered on target state characteristics. In the second column, we add covariates to account for the relationship that a target state has with the senders of the sanction, and the last incorporates our network level variables. 

As we go from left to right across the table, we see that explanations of sanction compliance centered on the target state become less prominent. We find no support for the argument that high levels of internal stability may prompt a country to comply. In Models 1 and 2, we find that countries with higher levels of GDP per capita take longer to comply to a sanction case, but after accounting for the network level characteristics the coefficient estimate for that variable more than halves. Our findings for the effect of a country's regime type on sanction compliance also diverge from what the extant literature would predict. Instead of finding that democracies are more likely to comply to a sanction case, we see that countries rated as more democratic take longer to comply than countries that are more autocratic. However, this effect is marginal at best, and once we control for the relationship between sender and target states this effect also becomes much weaker. 

We find strong support for our third hypothesis which stated that target states are more likely to comply to sanctions involving multiple actors, and the effect of this variable remains consistent even after controlling for our network level covariates in Model 3. Like the extant literature (e.g., \citealp{mclean2010friends}), we do find strong evidence for the ability of trading partners to obtain quick and successful resolutions to sanction cases. This is in line with our fourth hypothesis, that more proximate relationships between sender and recievers result in quicker compliance by the target state. But support for this general proximity hypothesis is limited to trade. States are not likely to comply more quickly to sanctions sent by allies or neighbors.

Our key hypotheses relate to the effect of compliance and sanction reciprocity. We incorporate these variables in the last column of table \ref{tab:regResults}, and here we find that target states comply much more quickly to sanctions sent from countries with whom they have a stronger history of compliance relative to others in the network. On the other hand, simply receiving sanctions from a particular sender relative to others in network, without necessarily complying, makes a target state less likely to comply. To assure that a few cases are not responsible for the regression estimates depicted in Table \ref{tab:regResults}, we randomly split our dataset of 653 sanction cases into ten sub-datasets of approximately equal size. We then reran model three . The coefficient estimates for compliance and sanction reciprocity when estimating across each of these subsamples remains consistent providing further confidence to our findings.

A key question that remains, however, is whether we are able to better explain sanction compliance through the incorporation of these network level covariates. By incorporating our network level covariates we also noticeably improve our ability to predict when states comply. Figure \ref{fig:auc} shows time-dependent AUC (area under the curve) statistics for each model, we vary the time parameter to range from 0 to 15 years.\footnote{Time-dependent AUCs were computed using the formula provided by \citet{chambless2006estimation}.} We set the max for 15 years because only 4\% of sanction cases in our dataset that extend past 15 years end with compliance by a target state. This leads to the AUC statistics for each model after that time point to begin to coalesce. Before the 15 year mark, however, we see noticeable variation in the time-dependent AUC statistics for each model. Most importantly, we can see that Model 3, where we incorporate our network level covariates, provides a noticeably higher AUC than the alternatives that we examined.

Because it is difficult to interpret the substantive meaning of point estimates from the hazard function in table \ref{tab:regResults}, we present graphical interpretations in figures \ref{fig:surv1}, \ref{fig:surv2}, and \ref{fig:surv3}. In each figure, the y-axis represents the probability of survival, or in this case the probability that a country will not comply and the x-axis represents time (measured in years). We use a red and a blue line to represent high and low values in our covariates of interest. In each graph, the red line represents the covariate of interest set to a low value (its lower quartile), and the blue line represents the covariate at a higher value (upper quartile). This allows us to more easily interpret the effects of each covariate. Figure \ref{fig:surv1} captures the ``number of senders'' covariate. In this case, the red line indicates a low number of senders and the blue line, a higher number. It is evident that as the number of senders increase, the liklihood of survival, or time to compliance, substantially decreases and almost halves in a few years.

The graphs in figure \ref{fig:surv2} demonstrate the effects of the ``proximate'' relationships that were significant in table \ref{tab:regResults}. The panel on the left shows the effect for distance. Here we can see that even though the coefficient estimate for this variable was significant, its substantive meaning is almost nil. For trade, on the other hand, there is a strong effect. We can clearly see that when a target state faces a sanction from countries with whom they frequently trade, they are much more likely to comply in a timely fashion.

Last, in figure \ref{fig:surv3}, we show the results for our network level covariates. In both cases, we can see that the substantive effects of these variables is quite strong.
