Table~\ref{table1} displays the results from our model. As expected, we find support for hypothesis one, which states that as the number of sender states increases for any given sanction case, the time to compliance will decrease. We also find support for our second hypothesis, that more proximate relationships between sender and recievers result in quicker compliance by the target state. However, support for this hypothesis is limited to the type of relationship or proximity that is measured. Our findings reveal that distance and religion are influential for predicting compliance. This suggests that target states are most sensitive to sanctions by those states whose are both neighbors and share cultural similarities. We also find support for hypothesis three, that states are more likely to comply to one sanction when they are simultaneously facing a number of others. 

We control for the prominent idea from the literature that domestic factors influence sanction compliance. We find that while our measure of internal stabiity does not play a role, %we need to define this variable somewhere. 
domestic institutions do matter. Interestingly, we find little support for trade and alliances having an influence on compliance. 
Because it is difficult to interpret the effect of point estimates on the hazard function in tabular form, we present a graphical interpretation below.
