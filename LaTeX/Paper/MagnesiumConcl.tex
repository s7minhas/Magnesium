\section*{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this paper we have shown that network variables do indeed play a substantive role in predicting sanction compliance. This indicates to us that the extant literature's focus on employing models that just capture the situation in the sanctioned country omits important information when it comes to understanding compliance. More work on our part, however, is necessary as well. A key next step is to determine the predictive accuracy of our models incorporating network characteristics, overall, and vis-a-vis models providing determinants at just the level of the sanctioned state. Additionally, we also hope to incorporate more substantive measures of the sanction network so that we can model the complex interdependencies that likely emerge and drive sanction and compliance behavior between states.
